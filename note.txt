# What is JSON?
# JSON is just a (usually) string whose contents follow a specific format
# So at its core, you've got: Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Lists. Objects (akin to dictionaries in Python)
# Note that objects are not ordered, so the keys could come back in any order. This is not a problem!
# At the top level of a piece of JSON you can have an object or a list. So this is also valid JSON
# When we return a Python dictionary in a Flask route, Flask automatically turns it into JSON for us, so we don't have to.
# Remember that "turning it into JSON" means two things: 
# 1. Change Python keywords and values so they match the JSON standard (eg True to true)
# 2. Turn the whole thing into a single string that our API can return.
